  about_title: Hello, Iâ€™m Keelan.
  about_subtitle: I serve as the George Liele Director of the Center for Great Commission Studies at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary
  about_description: |
    I also serve as instructor of missiology at the seminary. Previously, I served as the Associate Director for the Union Baptist Association in Houston, TX. 

    My areas of focus cover both North American and International missions. I teach and write on church renewal and replanting as well as developing healthy sending culture in churches. I have a passion for mobilizing the church to the nations, and a love for missions history. 

    I lead the Peoples Next Door project, which is an initiative to equip local churches in North America to engage in cross-cultural missions among the least-reached peoples that now live in our communities. I've been a church planter in West Africa with the IMB and facilitated ethnographic research in Washington, DC with NAMB.
