I guess it was only a matter of time before I got the itch to blog. After all, I do have a bit of free time here, and God is teaching me a whole lot so far through this process. So, for all of the people who are contacting me for updates and wanting to know what in the world is going on over here, this blog's for you.

I wish I knew what to tell you to expect on here, but, alas, I do not. I have a feeling it will be quite the eclectic mix of journal entries, articles, opinions, and the occasional bible study notes. Those of you who sat under my teaching won't find this hard to believe, but I really miss my soapbox. I imagine anyone called to teach can understand my sentiments. Maybe I'm just getting nostalgic looking back on my position behind that podium in the college wing every Wednesday night. Then again, maybe this is simply the same desire to share what God has laid on my heart that got me behind that podium in the first place.

Whatever the case, I find myself seeking to share, if you're interested in listening...
