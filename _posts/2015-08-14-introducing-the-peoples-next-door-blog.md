"Necessity is the mother of invention." At least, that's what people say.

For the last couple of years, Southeastern Seminary has worked on our Peoples Next Door project. Peoples Next Door exists to help train and equip local churches to discover and engage the unreached people groups in their communities. We do this by providing resources and partnering with state conventions, associations, missions agencies, and especially local churches. This project continues to grow, and we now need a home for it on the internet.

Enter the Peoples Next Door website.

Here on the website, you will find continued resources for discovery and engagement. Local churches around the country are seeing the need to engage the people groups cropping up in their neighborhoods and communities. Hopefully, we can help by providing both downloadable resources (such as documents, videos, and other helps) as well as syndicated content (such as blogs, articles, and maybe even podcasts). So if you are interested in reaching the people groups next door, then follow us and visit often.

Feel free to poke around the site and ask questions if you have any.

For now, head over to the [Peoples Next Door homepage](http://blog.keelancook.com) and start!
