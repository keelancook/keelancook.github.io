This blog is actually several years older than its most recent launch as The Peoples Next Door. I initially started this blog when I was serving in West Africa, and this week I began digging through the archives.

Back in 2012, I wrote a piece that I feel is worth repeating on the difference between privacy and secrecy. In my estimation, we have confused a right to the former with an entitlement to the latter. If so, then that is a big deal, and it may be one reason that real biblical community in local churches is so hard to achieve.

Where secrecy exists real fellowship cannot.Â Nevertheless, so many of us go through the motions of Christian community today without ever experiencing it. We live as active members of a local church, regularly attending services, signing up for programs and studies, faithfully putting money in the offering plate, and yet never developing real community.
