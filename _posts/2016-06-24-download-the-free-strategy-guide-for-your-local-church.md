I am excited about today's post. Over the course of the Peoples Next Door project, we have spent a lot of time thinking through people group discovery and engagement as well as helping equip local churches for that end. Today, I get to announce a free, downloadable strategy guide to help local churches think through both finding and engaging people groups in their area.

Here is an excerpt from the introduction:

> In Acts 17, Paul reminds his listeners at the Areopagus that God determines the periods and boundaries of man, so that they can seek Him and perhaps find Him. God is doing something big, and he is doing it in your town, maybe even your neighborhood, right now. Over the course of 20-30 years, global migration patterns have increased to new highs. More people are moving from country to country than ever before, and many of those peoples are moving to North America. While doors into the hardest-to-reach nations are rapidly closing to missionaries, God is orchestrating a movement of these least reached peoples into the heartland of evangelical Christianity. The least-reached peoples are now in arms reach of your local church. So, the question is... what will you do about it?
> 
> The Peoples Next Door Project is an effort to equip local churches, associations, conventions, and others to discover and engage international people groups in North America. The following is a step-by-step strategy guide compiled from _The Peoples Next Door: A Primer for Reaching the Nations in Your Neighborhood_ (coming soon!). The guide lays a foundation for this work in local churches. It is necessarily broad, and each church will want to apply these principles in their specific setting. However, by considering these broad steps, any church can begin the journey.

You can get your copy of the strategy guide by clicking on the link below and downloading the PDF file. As we have them available, you can find other resources by clicking on the resources tab in the menu at the top of the page.

Also, help us spread the word! We want these resources in the hands of as many churches as possible.
