One of the joys of my job is serving as cohost for our seminary's missions podcast, [The Sent Life](https://open.spotify.com/show/7HmzNpfnTnrT62Vu0M64Zm). Scott Hildreth and I talk each week about Christian missions and a whole bundle of topics that relate to it.

The following is a series we did which really defines the core of our purpose on The Sent Life. It is a six episode mini-series on the foundations of Southern Baptist cooperation. There is soemthing unique about the way we as a family of churches have partnered together for so long now. This series provides commentary and description on that partnership, why we do it, how we do it, and why it's so important.

Feel free to give it a listen, and let me know if you have any questions. You can always reach me through contact info here on my website.
