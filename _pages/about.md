> The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!

Whether it's through thoughtful design, cutting-edge technology, or engaging content, we aim to create something that resonates with people on a deeper level.

*Before launching the project*

At the core of our mission lies a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of creativity and innovation. We are a dynamic collective of designers, thinkers, and visionaries, each bringing a unique perspective to the table, united by a common purpose: to create meaningful and impactful experiences that resonate with people across the globe.

Our journey is one of relentless exploration, where every challenge is seen as an opportunity to push boundaries and redefine what's possible.

We approach every project with a blend of curiosity, passion, and expertise, committed to crafting solutions that not only meet the needs of today but also anticipate the demands of tomorrow. Our work spans the intersection of design and technology, where we strive to create products and experiences that are not only functional but also deeply engaging and visually compelling. We believe in the importance of storytelling, using our skills to weave narratives that connect, inspire, and provoke thought.

My name is Keelan Cook. I'm married to Meredith and we have two little kids, Nora and Ezra. I recently took the role of George Liele Director for the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org) at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](https://sebts.edu) where I also serve on faculty teaching Christian missions.</p>

Before we moved back to Wake Forest, we lived in Houston, TX where I served with the [Union Baptist Association](https://ubahouston.org) as an associate director. I've worked overseas as a missionary in a Muslim region of West Africa, and I've done a good bit of research on diaspora and urban missions.

I continue to do a lot of research and writing because of my particular ministry assignment, and I regularly pray it is a benefit to the local church. I hope this space provides an easy way to share that work with others and as a source of edification for you. If you want to know more about my current and previous work, feel free to browse my [Curriculum Vitae](https://keelancook.com/cv).

## About the Website
This website serves as a tool for pastors, ministers, students, and laypeople alike to be better equipped for that most important task given by Christ to his church. I want all that I do to point to the priority of gospel proclamation among the nations in the mission of the church.

However, this site views that purpose through a wide-angle lens. Future posts may deal with pastoral ministry, theology, church history, current events and cultural exegesis, or even practical advice for students on how to be faithful in their studies. This website will accomplish this in at least three ways:</p>

### The Blog
Articles have always been the backbone of this website. The site's main interface is a blog where I plan to continue writing for the church and hopefully incorporating other voices as well along the way. In addition to this new content, this website hosts hundreds of articles I have written over the course of a decade.

I want all of that content to be as accessible as possible, so the new format allows multiple ways to interact with these articles. First, you can find the normal blog feed of articles on the homepage. There, you will see a couple of featured posts at the top. These may change over time. Below them will be the regular roll of articles.

You can also search based on categories at the bottom of the page. The list of article categories is listed next to "Explore". You can click on any category to see those posts.

### The Commonplace Book
In addition to complete articles, I am trying something new on this site by including a live look at many of my research notes with an online commonplace book. On this portion of the site, you can scroll through linked notes of research and smaller, often incomplete notes concerning church and mission. I am hopeful that this experiment serves as another resource in addition to helping me "think in public" along with the input of others.

You can find my commonplace book here: [Public Notes](https://notes.keelancook.com). And to read more about what this is, check out the [About Page](https://notes.keelancook.com/about).

Thanks for reading!
